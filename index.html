        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>For the first part of your project, you will be creating a design using three different shapes, each of which appears in three different size variations. Students must redraw their design digitally using Illustrator, then rearrange the design on a second artboard.</p>
        <p>For more details about the project, see the handout provided by your instructor.</p>
        <h2>Class Files</h2>
        <p>In the class files folder, there are a number of resources which may be useful, including a scanned design, example projects, and tutorial files we will use along the way.</p>

        <h1>The Illustrator Interface</h1>
        <h2>Application Frame Mode</h2>
        <p>In Mac OS, the Illustrator interface behaves differently than in Windows. In Windows, documents, menus, toolbars, etc, are grouped together inside one window, but, in Mac OS, documents float freely from other components and can be maximized/minimized independently of the application itself.</p>
        <p>Mac OS users who prefer the Windows approach can mimic it by using Application Frame mode. To turn on Application Frame mode, go to <span class="type-text">Window > Application Frame</span>.</p>
        <h2>Using Pre-Defined Workspace Layouts</h2>
        <p>Illustrator offers so many features that the Workspace can quickly become cluttered. To simplify things, we’ll use one of Illustrator’s pre-defined combinations of panels and menus, which are known as Workspace Layouts.</p>
        <p>In the upper-right corner of the window, set the drop-down menu to Essentials. This gives us a basic set of tools and panels.</p>
        <p>The resulting interface should look like the following image, with the Document Window, Application Bar, Tools Panel, Control Bar and Panel Dock displayed. These items are discussed on the next few pages.</p>
        <div class="full-width-image"> <img src="images/interface-components.png" /> </div>
        <div class="important center">
            <h3>Control Panel Not Appearing?</h3>
            <p>As of Illustrator 2018, the <strong>Control Panel strip at the top of the screen is off by default</strong>.</p>
            <p> To enable this feature for easier access to alignment and fill/stroke tools, go to <strong class="highlight">Window > Control</strong></p>
        </div>
        <h2>Common Interface Components</h2>
        <p><b>The Document Window </b>displays the file that you are currently working on. If you have multiple files open, each file appears as a tab in the Document Window, as shown below. The white rectangle inside the Document Window, which displays the printable area of the Workspace, is called the Artboard.</p>
        <p><b>The Application Bar </b>contains the Workspace Switcher menu and a shortcut to Adobe Bridge, an application used for image management. On Windows machines, the Application Bar also contains the File, Edit, View, etc menus.</p>
        <p><b>The Tools Panel </b>contains tools used to create and manipulate artwork. To select a tool, simply click it. Tools with a triangle in the lower-right corner have additional tools hidden beneath them. To display hidden tools, click and hold a tool icon; a drop-down menu showing the hidden tools will appear.</p>
        <p><b>The Control Panel </b>displays options for the currently selected tool. Control Bar options are generally a small subset of those available in other panels and menus. Keep in mind that there may be additional options for your selected tool beyond those displayed in the Control Bar.</p>
        <p><b>The Panels Dock. </b>Panels are menus that allow you to monitor and modify your artwork. By default, all Panels are closed and hidden beneath icons in the Panel Dock. Icons in the Panel Dock represent groups of related Panels; to open a Panel Group, click an icon in the Panel Dock. Each Panel within a Panel Group is displayed on a separate tab. To bring a Panel to the front of the group, click its tab. To close a Panel group, click the double arrows in the upper-right corner of the Panel Group. Panels can also be displayed individually. To show a panel, go to the Window menu and Click its name. To hide the panel, go to the Window menu and Click the panel name again.</p>

        <h1>Navigating the Workspace</h1>

        <p>Working in Illustrator often involves moving around the workspace in order to focus on different portions of your project. In this section, we discuss a few methods of navigating the workspace.</p>






        <h2>Selection Tool</h2>
        <div class="reference">
            <img src="images/icon-selection.png" alt="Icon for the Selection tool">

        <h2>Hand Tool</h2>
        <div class="reference">

        <h1>Preparing Your Document</h1>
        <h2>Adding a Border</h2>
        <p>Before placing our image, we will first add a border to both artboards so that we can see the artboard’s edge after printing.</p> <img class="sidebar-icon" src="images/icon-rectangle.png" />
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>
                <p>Click on the Rectangle tool.</p>
            </li>
            <div class="side-image-medium"> <img src="images/create-rectangle-1.png" /> </div>
            <li>
                <p>Click once in the artboard, and specify the dimensions of the rectangle as 6 inches width and 10 inches height.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Change the stroke to black and the fill to none.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Make sure the stroke width is set at 1 pt.</p>
            </li>
            <div class="centered-image-medium"> <img src="images/create-rectangle-2.png" /> </div>
            <li>
                <p>Position the rectangle so it outlines the artboard. Copy and paste this rectangle in the second artboard and position it to outline this artboard.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Placing an Image</h2>
        <p>Placing an image in Illustrator is a good way to begin making a vector version of a drawn design. Placing an image is different than pasting. It creates a link back to the image file. You must keep the image in the same place or embed the image to ensure you don’t lose it. The students should be prepared with a scanned image of their design. If they do not have a design with them, they can place the class file <span class="type-text">MyDesign.jpeg.</span></p>
        <div class="sidebar-note">
            <h2>Resize Proportionally</h2>
            <p>Holding down the <kbd>shift</kbd> key when resizing an object will ensure it maintains the original proportions.</p>
        </div>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>
                <p><span class="type-text">File > Place…</span>select your file. (Instructors will use <span class="type-text">MyDesign.jpeg</span>)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click Embed in the Control Panel to add the image to the Illustrator file.</p>
            </li> <img class="sidebar-icon" src="images/icon-selection.png" />
            <li>
                <p>Drag your image into the desired location with the Selection Tool.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Resize by clicking on a white anchor point in the corners of the image and dragging outward or inward.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Using Clipping Masks to Crop</h3>
        <p>Illustrator does not feature a crop tool, so if you need to crop your image in any way you will have to use a clipping mask.</p>
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>
                <p>Using the Rectangle tool, draw a rectangle with no stroke and no fill over top of your image, specifically over the area you want to cut out of your image. When you use the clipping mask, it will remove all parts of the image that are not covered by this rectangle.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select both the image and the rectangle at the same time by holding down Shift and clicking on each.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Go to <span class="type-text">Object > Clipping Mask > Make</span>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Opacity</h2>
        <div class="side-image-medium"> <img src="images/image-opacity.png" /> </div>
        <p>Turning down the opacity of our image will help us be able to trace it more easily, the same way one would used tracing paper to trace an image. With the image selected, navigate to the Control Panel and where it says Opacity 100%, enter in a value around 50% and click enter.</p>
        <h2>Locking</h2>
        <div class="sidebar-note">
            <h2>Locking Shortcuts</h2>
            <p>Lock shortcut for Mac:<br><kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>2</kbd></p>
            <p>Lock shortcut for Windows:<br><kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>2</kbd></p>
        </div>
        <p>To lock the object, select your placed image by clicking on it with the Selection Tool, then navigate to <span class="type-text">Object > Lock > Selection.</span>You can also do this in your layers panel by finding the layer you are on and clicking in the lock box to toggle the lock layer feature.</p>
        <p>To Unlock, navigate to <span class="type-text">Object > Unlock all</span>, or find the shape in layers panel and unlock by clicking on the lock icon.</p>
        <p>We will work on your image later on in class, after you learn some tools.</p>

        <h1>Copying and Resizing Shapes</h1>
        <p>Now we will work with creating shapes in a variety of ways. Begin by opening the practice class file by going to <span class="type-text">File > Open</span> and choosing <span class="type-text">shapes.ai</span></p>
        <p>Instructions for shapes are also available in the <span class="type-text">shapes.ai file</span>, and these exercises correspond with Video 1.</p>

                <p>Hold down shift to constrain proportions and resize the circle by clicking on a corner port (white square) and dragging out. Hold down shift until after you finish resizing.</p>
            </li>

        <p>Repeat these two exercises with the rectangle tool and the next <span class="type-text">shapes.ai</span> set of shapes.</p>
        <h2>Option-Drag Copying</h2>
        <p>This is the fastest and most many times most effective way of copying. Take time to learn and practice this technique! Make a copy by first clicking and dragging a circle you made over the last circle in the template. Before letting go of your mouse, hold down <kbd>Alt/Option</kbd>. You’ll see your arrow tool change to a double arrow indicating you're making a copy. Let go of the mouse, then let go of <kbd>Alt/Option</kbd>. Resize your shape again, practice using both <kbd>Shift</kbd> and <kbd>Alt/Option</kbd> to resize. Repeat with Rectangle.</p>
        <h2>Triangle</h2>
        <p>The triangle shape is made using the polygon tool.</p> <img class="sidebar-icon" src="images/icon-polygon.png" />
        <ol class="instruction-list">
            <li>
                <p>Choose the polygon tool.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click once anywhere on your document and a dialogue box will appear.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Enter 3 sides and disregard the size because we can resize our triangle with the Selection Tool.</p>

                <p>The <b>Direct Selection Tool</b> allows you to select individual anchor points or path segments by clicking on them, or select an entire path or group by selecting any other spot on the item. This tool is used for manipulating individual anchor points of a path directly.</p>
            </div>
            <div> <img src="images/icon-deleteanchorpoint.png" />
                <p>The <b>Delete Anchor Point Tool</b> deletes anchor points when you click on them.</p>
            </div>
            <div> <img src="images/icon-addanchorpoint.png" />
                <p>The <b>Add Anchor Point Tool</b> adds anchor points to a path when you click on it.</p>
            </div>
            <div> <img src="images/icon-anchorpoint.png" />
                <p>The <b>Anchor Point Tool</b> is used to manipulate individual anchor points, like the Direct Selection tool, but can also be used to convert anchor points to curves or corners.</p>
            </div>
            <div> <img src="images/icon-convertcorner.png" />
                <p>When you have an anchor point selected with the Anchor Point tool, this icon will appear in the options bar. Clicking it when you have a curved anchor point selected will convert the anchor point to a corner.</p>

            <div> <img src="images/icon-convertcurve.png" />
                <p>When you have an anchor point selected with the Anchor Point tool, this icon will appear in the options bar. Clicking it when you have a corner anchor point selected will convert the anchor point to a curve.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Change fill to none and stroke to any color. (You can change the color at any point, but it’s helpful to have a distinctly different color when tracing).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click once to lay down an anchor point. Do not click and drag (unless you are VERY comfortable already with the pen tool). Roughly lay down anchor points along the line.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Then use the Anchor Point tool to click and drag handles from an anchor point to create a curve.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Use the template in <span class="type-text">shapes.ai to practice!</span></p>
        <h2>Open Path</h2>
        <p>When you are finished with your open path like a line or an arrow, simply click on the selection tool in the tools panel and you will notice that your path has become a line.</p>
        <p>To close a path, hover your pen tool cursor over the first anchor point you laid and your pen tool cursor icon will show a small circle next to it, meaning that once you click on the original beginning anchor point, you will have closed the path.</p>
        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>First make sure your fill is set to none. Then trace the Swish Star laying down the anchor points, then going back to curve the lines using the Convert Anchor Point Tool.</p>
